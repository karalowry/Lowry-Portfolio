# Final Part Two: Storyboarding and User Research

This is part two of my final project. I will walk through my storyboard, my interview process for user research, and my findings from the interviews.

# Storyboard

I completed my storyboard by making a draft of my project on Shorthand. I imagine my final project will follow a similar structure, and for me it was easiest to just start compiling the story in a similar format I imagine the end project will be. I also upgraded my sketches to actual visualizations using Flourish, Canva, and Infogram. I think I will be able to get better responses out of my user research by having my visualizations be accurate and cleaned-up. Furthermore, once I started to dive into the data I realized some of my previous sketches were not going to work or I could not find the actual data I needed, so I had to change some of the visualizations to fit the story better.

# User Research Protocol

Below is my user research protocol, including my target audience, interview questions, interviewee responses, my takeaways from the interviews, and my next steps.

## Target Audiences

The target audience for my project is people who are interested in learning more about affordable housing and/or care about alleviating poverty in America. I imagine most of my readers would not know too much about a universal housing program or the severity of the affordable housing crisis in general. In my mind, most of my readers are college-aged students or younger people who care about making a change in our society, but are not experts on every policy solution.

My sample of interviewees fit this criteria. My first interviewee is a graduate student studying public health who knows access to affordable, stable housing is vital, but does not have expertise in the field. My second interviewee is a graduate student studying public policy who is interested in community development. Affordable housing is something they make work on in the future, so they want to take the time now to learn as much as they can about the subject. My third interviewee is a graduate student studying student affairs. While affordable housing does not relate directly to their field of study, this person is passionate about making a difference in our country and is aware housing is a major issue.

## Interview Script and Questions

**Introduction:** Thank you for meeting with me today. The goal of this interview is to get your feedback on a project I have been working on about affordable housing. The project is not completed, so the words on the project are not finalized. I mostly want you to get the flow of the project, what information will be presented, and what information is already presented through the visualizations. After you scroll through this project, I am going to ask you a couple questions about your impressions and thoughts.

**Questions:**

| Goal | Question |
| ---| |---|
| Visual Appeal | After scrolling through, what did you like about how the project looked? What did you not like? |
| Clarity of Visualizations | Looking at the data visualizations, was anything confusing? Did you understand the purpose of each visualization? |
| Flow of the Story | Did the order of the sections make sense to you? |
| Call to Action | After scrolling through, would you be inclined to do one of the call to actions? |
| Additional Insights | Is there anything else you would change or you think needs improvement? |

**Closing:** Thank you so much for your time today. I really appreciate your willingness to speak with me.

## Interviewee Responses

**Interviewee One**

| Question | Response |
| --- | --- |
| After scrolling through, what did you like about how the project looked? What did you not like? | "I liked the color scheme and how it was consist throughout the document. I liked the graphics, especially the interactive map. I also like that it tells you what you can do about the issue. There is kind of a lot of graphs or charts that look the same, so it may be a little overwhelming. I wish there were clearer divides between sections." |
| Looking at the data visualizations, was anything confusing? Did you understand the purpose of each visualization? | "The housing vouchers being funded less than the other programs that exist feels weird. It seems like it is piting these fundings against each other when all of these programs are needed and need funding." |
| Did the order of the sections make sense to you? | "Yeah. History, current standing, what are alternative options, and what you can do about it. I think the section about why we should care about housing should be more emphasized. I don't think people know how important housing is for all of these other things." |
| After scrolling through, would you be inclined to do one of the call to actions? | "I would not call people probably, but I like the idea of connecting to other groups. I would talk to my friends about it." |
| Is there anything else you would change or think needs improvement? | "Just the dividing of the sections, and breaking the why we should care section into a bigger part." |
