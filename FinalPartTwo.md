# Final Part Two: Storyboarding and User Research

This is part two of my final project. I will walk through my storyboard, my interview process for user research, and my findings from the interviews.

# Storyboard

I completed my storyboard by making a draft of my project on Shorthand. I imagine my final project will follow a similar structure, and for me it was easiest to just start compiling the story in a similar format I imagine the end project will be. I also upgraded my sketches to actual visualizations using Flourish, Canva, and Infogram. I think I will be able to get better responses out of my user research by having my visualizations be accurate and cleaned-up. Furthermore, once I started to dive into the data I realized some of my previous sketches were not going to work or I could not find the actual data I needed, so I had to change some of the visualizations to fit the story better.

# User Research Protocol

Below is my user research protocol, including my target audience, interview questions, interviewee responses, my takeaways from the interviews, and my next steps.

## Target Audiences

The target audience for my project is people who are interested in learning more about affordable housing and/or care about alleviating poverty in America. I imagine most of my readers would not know too much about a universal housing program or the severity of the affordable housing crisis in general. In my mind, most of my readers are college-aged students or younger people who care about making a change in our society, but are not experts on every policy solution.

My sample of interviewees fit this criteria. My first interviewee is a graduate student studying public health who knows access to affordable, stable housing is vital, but does not have expertise in the field. My second interviewee is a graduate student studying public policy who is interested in community development. Affordable housing is something they make work on in the future, so they want to take the time now to learn as much as they can about the subject. My third interviewee is a graduate student studying student affairs. While affordable housing does not relate directly to their field of study, this person is passionate about making a difference in our country and is aware housing is a major issue.
