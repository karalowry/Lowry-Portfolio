# Final Part Two: Storyboarding and User Research

This is part two of my final project. I will walk through my storyboard, my interview process for user research, and my findings from the interviews.

# Storyboard

I completed my storyboard by making a draft of my project on Shorthand. I imagine my final project will follow a similar structure, and for me it was easiest to just start compiling the story in a similar format I imagine the end project will be. I also upgraded my sketches to actual visualizations using Flourish, Canva, and Infogram. I think I will be able to get better responses out of my user research by having my visualizations be accurate and cleaned-up.
