# Final Part Three: The Finished Product

This part of my project contains some reflections on my project process and the link to the final product. 

# Project Reflections

I chose my audience to be younger people who are inclined to want to make progress in our society, but may not know how to do so with every issue. After interviewing three people who fit that category, it seemed like my project was working well for that audience. I think my project makes it easy to understand the issue we have with affordable housing and a solution we can advocate for. I think the design of my project fits well with my audience as it is pretty modern looking. I also think the tone I use in my writing is slightly informal, which makes it feel like I am talking directly to the audience. I feel like that tone works well with younger people. 

After my user research, I spent time making each section of my project more distinct so that they can better follow along the direction of the story. I also changed my call to action to include emailing representatives instead of just calling because all three of my interviewees mentioned they would be unlikely to call their representatives. I think emailing and using the Intentet for activism is something that the younger eneration is more intersted in. After adding context to my project, I actually asked my first interviewee for feedback again regarding some of the visualizations that they felt were a little confusing. This helped me know what words I needed to add to ensure that my visualizations were coming off correctly.

My design was based around the teal background color that Shorthand had to offer. I thought about colors that worked well with a bright teal, and decided on black and white. After that, I tried to ensure that all of my graphics and visualizations followed the color scheme and had similar looks to them. I also used columns so that there was a nice balance between text and images.
