# Assignment: Prediction Models

In this assignment, I used the Forest-Based Classification and Regression tool to predict voter turnout in Iowa by county. Through the tool, I was able to explore the variable importance in predicting voter turnout and the model's stability through prediction interval graphs. The assignment went through various ways of improving the model, such as adding and subtracting variables from the model based on variable importance levels, and increasing the number of trees and model runs.

This screenshot shows the prediction of voter turnout by county in Iowa based off of the data that was fed to the prediction model.

## Assignment Reflections

I think this exercise helped me understand the Forest-Based Classification and Regression tool better. I think running through the iterative process allowed me to grasp how to make the model better and see what the changes I was making were doing to the model's validity.  It is really useful to have this tool as a way of performing regressions, and being able to visualize it on a map as well. In undergrad, I did a senior thesis utilizing similar data as the exercise and did regression analyses to see how well the three variables I chose could predict what percentage of a state legislature would be women. Had I been able to use GIS, it would have offered a better view of comparing states instead of just using tables and graphs. Additionally, having the predictive capabilities to compare to the actual percentage of women in the state legislatures would have been really interesting. I think this tool is really useful for campaigning/voter turnout as the exercise goes through, but I think it would also be useful for predicting other factors like home values, educational outcomes, health outcomes, etc.
