# About Me

![Me with my cats Azula (left) and Mai (right)](Picture1.png)

My name is Kara Lowry and my pronouns are she/her. I am a first-year student in the Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management program. I am originally from outside of Louisville, Kentucky, but I moved to Pittsburgh in 2019 for the Coro Fellowship in Public Affairs. I have two cats named Azula and Mai that I got during quarantine so they have a little bit of separation anxiety. I love to read, cook new recipes, and watch reality TV.



# What I Hope to Learn
 I am interested in learning more about how to create data visualization that are easy to understand so that I can better explain and express why we need major changes in multiple sectors of our society. Once I graduate I hope to be working in some capacity to make policies that are more inclusive and work to build up the most underserved people in our communities. I am most interested in social policy, criminal justice reform, and education policy.
