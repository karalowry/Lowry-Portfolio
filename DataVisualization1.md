# Comparison of Visualizations

The first visualization was created using the OCED's website, and shows the debt-to-GDP ratio for thirty countries only in the year 2019. You can easily compare countries to each other and see which has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio and which has the lowest due to the arrangement of the bars ascending from lowest to highest. The second visualization was created using the OCED's data and shows the debt-to-GDP ratio change over time from 1995-2018 for thirty-five countries. This visualization allows you to see the change over time for each country, but unlike the first visualization, it does not allow you to easily compare countries to each other since they are all on their own graphs and spread out. The third visualization uses the OCED's data to show the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995-2018 for the top seven GDP countries available in the data according to Investopedia. I chose this visualization in order to better visualize the change in debt-to-GDP ratio over time using the animation. I chose the seven countries with the highest GDPs because it made the visualization less crowded, and I think they are countries that someone may be interested in exploring more since they are some of the largest economies in the world. My visualization allows for a better comparison of these countries by showing the change in which country has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio at a every year on the same graph, as opposed to the second visualization which has each country on a separate graph. My visualization also allows you to highlight countries of interest, as well as choose the year of interest, but the second graph does a better job of showing the data per year while still showing the whole trend.
