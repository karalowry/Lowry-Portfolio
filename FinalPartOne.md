# Final Part One: Initial Planning

This is part one of my final project. I will describe my project outline, provide some initial sketches, share the data, and discuss the methods for the final design.

## Project Outline

For my final project, I want to use data visualizations to tell the story of the affordable housing crisis in America. I think this is a topic that has not gotten the attention it deserves, but has been brought to light more due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to show the dire situation America is in, but then offer a solution that readers can advocate for to improve housing in America: a universial housing program.
